Hello User!

To use this local server hosted client, you must first make sure you have python installed.
In your shell write:

Windows:
python --version
or
python3 --version
Linux:
python --version
or
python3 --version

Install dependencies using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt

First you must ensure you're in the right directory.
Next, you must start up the server using the terminal.

Windows:
python .\chat_server.py
or
python3 .\chat_server.py
Linux:
python chat_server.py
or
python3 chat_server.py

Now, in a new terminal, open the client.

Windows:
python .\GUI.py
or
python3 .\GUI.py
Linux:
python GUI.py
or
python3 GUI.py

Do this for as many clients as you're trying to connect to the server.
To use the client there is an input box at the bottom, write what you want to send to other users in that text box and click send when finished.
What you wrote will send to everybody's chat box and your text box will refresh itself waiting for further input.
If you want to disconnect from the server, click the X button on the client window and close it, the server will disconnect you when you leave.
